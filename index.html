        <br />
        <h4>Beginning</h4>
        <p>
          I was born on 16th September 1970 in Zugdidi, Georgia. A small and
          skinny child, I grew up in the streets of Old Station, a neighbourhood
          of my town with lots of urban stadiums. In my first tenth, I noticed
          competitive spirit, which all of my older friends had. They had a
          dream, once to play in front of all Georgians and make them proud.

            id="vajeksa"
          />

        <br />
        <h4>First years as pro</h4>
        <p>
          At the age of 16, I joined Odishi Football Club. From there began my
          path as a pro footballer. First season was tough: I couldn't get
          enough playtime to prove myself, but following year was a bit luckier.
          With an injury of the main Centre-Back - Luka Norakidze - I finally
          got opportunities to show my skills in real games. Everything went
          smooth: tackle after tackle, clearance after clearance I was becoming
          better.

        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>First and last move</h4>
        <p>
          As everything, good times also have an end. It was time for me to
          perform on a higher level. My two-season journey in Odishi was over
          and I moved to Dinamo Tbilisi FC. Even though I struggled a lot at the
          beginning, in half-season I got primary spot as Centre-Back. As my
          long-time teammate - Giorgi Gvinjilia loved to say: "Attack wins you
          matches, defence wins you titles."
